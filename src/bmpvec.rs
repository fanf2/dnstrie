//! Short bitmap-packed vectors
//! ===========================
//!
//! A [`BmpVec`] is a sparse vector of up to 64 elements. It only stores the
//! elements that are present, not the gaps between them. A bitmap ("bmp" for
//! short) indicates which elements are present or not.
//!
//! There is a trick to find an element in the underlying vector: create a
//! bitmask covering the bits in the bitmap less than the element we are
//! looking for, then count how many bits covered by the mask are set. This
//! can be done quickly with the `popcount` instruction, aka "population
//! count" or "Hamming weight", or (in Rust) `count_ones`, or "sideways add"
//! according to Knuth.
//!
//! See also "Hacker's Delight" by Henry S. Warren Jr, section 5-1.
